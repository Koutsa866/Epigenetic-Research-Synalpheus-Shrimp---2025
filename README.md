# Epigenetic-Research-Synalpheus-Shrimp---2025

## ðŸ§  Project Summary

This project investigates the epigenetic basis of eusociality in Synalpheus chacei, a sponge-dwelling snapping shrimp that exhibits complex social behaviors, including reproductive division of labor and cooperative brood careâ€”traits that have independently evolved multiple times within this genus.

Focusing on DNA methylation at CpG islands, we explore how epigenetic modifications may regulate gene expression patterns associated with eusocial traits. Using Oxford Nanopore sequencing data, we identify heavily methylated regions across the genome and assess their overlap with CpG islands and nearby genes. We hypothesize that methylated CpG islands located near regulatory regions influence the expression of genes critical to social structure and division of labor. This work aims to uncover novel molecular mechanisms underlying social evolution in marine invertebrates and broaden our understanding of epigenetic regulation beyond traditional model organisms.

## ðŸ”¬ Methods

## ðŸ”¬ Workflow Overview

### 1. **Nanopore Sequencing and Methylation Tag Extraction**
- Sequenced DNA with Oxford Nanopore MinION
- Used **Dorado** for basecalling and extraction of:
  - **MM tags** (modified cytosines)
  - **ML tags** (probabilities of modification)
- Filtered for methylation probabilities >95%

### 2. Methylation Quantification and BLAST Annotation (Summer 2024)
	â€¢	Calculated the proportion of methylated cytosines per read
	â€¢	Identified the top 10 reads with the highest proportion of methylation (up to ~10%)
	â€¢	These reads were hypothesized to overlap with CpG islands and regulatory regions
	â€¢	Annotated the top methylated sequences using BLASTn and BLASTx against:
	â€¢	nr, tsa_nr, and core_nt databases
	â€¢	Functions inferred from BLAST results were used to assess potential roles in eusocial traits

### 3. **CpG Island Detection and Methylation Overlay**
- Used Python to detect CpG islands based on:
  - GC content â‰¥ 50%
  - Obs/Exp CpG ratio â‰¥ 0.6
  - Length â‰¥ 200 bp
- Mapped methylation tags to CpG islands
- Calculated:
  - % methylation per island
  - % of island bases methylated
  - Methylation thresholds (e.g. >70%) to classify islands as methylated

  ### 4. **Genome Chunking and Gene Prediction**
- Split genome assembly into 2,800+ contigs
- Organized into 56 batches of 50 files each (`contigs_batch_1` to `contigs_batch_56`)
- Ran **AUGUSTUS** gene prediction (via bash in Google Colab) on all batches using:
  ```
  --species=fly
  --gff3=on
  --UTR=on
  --print_utr=on
  --protein=on
  ```
- Output: ~2,800 `.gff` files stored in batch-labeled folders in `augustus_output/`

### 5. **Gene-CpG Island Association** *(Next Step)*
- Convert `.gff` predictions to `.bed` format
- Use **BEDTools** to identify genes overlapping or near methylated CpG islands
- Goal: Identify potential regulatory relationships

### 6. **Gene Annotation and Functional Insights** *(Upcoming)*
- Annotate predicted genes using **eggNOG-mapper** or **InterProScan**
- Perform **GO enrichment** to detect overrepresented functions
- Visualize results with **IGV** or **UCSC Genome Browser**

### 7. **Machine Learning Model (Exploratory)**
- Use **H2O AutoML** to predict gene methylation status from features:
  - CpG island features
  - Distance to gene TSS
  - Island length, GC content, etc.

## ðŸ“Š Results Summary

- Median read length: 2,561 bp (range: 5â€“38,026 bp)
- 82% of reads contained â‰¥1 high-confidence methylated cytosine
- Median methylation proportion: 0.006
- Some sequences had >10% mC, possibly within CpG islands
- Top 10 methylated reads were annotated using BLAST and found to contain hits to genes with possible regulatory or functional roles
- Total CpG islands identified genome-wide: 5,423,765
- Methylated CpG islands (â‰¥70% methylation threshold): 5,123,226
- Proportion of methylated CpG islands: 94.46%
- These CpG island metrics were derived after integrating methylation call data with CpG island locations, supporting the hypothesis that widespread methylation may influence gene regulation in Synalpheus chacei.

## ðŸ§  Research Significance

This is one of the first genome-wide studies of DNA methylation in a eusocial marine invertebrate. By integrating methylation data, CpG island detection, gene prediction, and functional annotation, this research sheds light on the epigenetic regulation of complex social behavior in a non-insect system.
