## ðŸ“˜ Project Summary

This project investigates the role of DNA methylationâ€”particularly at CpG islandsâ€”in regulating gene expression related to eusocial behavior in *Synalpheus chacei*, a sponge-dwelling snapping shrimp. Eusociality in this genus has independently evolved multiple times and features traits such as reproductive division of labor and cooperative brood care, making it a compelling model for epigenetic evolution.

We hypothesize that methylated CpG islands near gene regulatory regions are associated with expression changes in genes underlying eusocial traits.

##  Workflow and Methods

### 1. Nanopore Sequencing and Methylation Tag Extraction
- Sequenced *S. chacei* DNA using Oxford Nanopore MinION
- Used **Dorado** for basecalling and methylation tag extraction:
  - **MM tags** (locations of modified cytosines)
  - **ML tags** (probabilities of methylation)
- Retained only reads with methylation probabilities >95%

### 2. Methylation Quantification and Annotation
- Quantified methylated cytosines per read using R
- Filtered for high-confidence methylation (â‰¥95% probability)
- Identified top 10 most methylated reads (~10% methylation)
- Annotated these reads with BLASTn and BLASTx (nr, tsa_nr, core_nt)
- Interpreted gene functions relevant to potential eusocial traits

### 3. CpG Island Detection and Methylation Overlay
- Detected CpG islands using a custom Python script:
  - GC content â‰¥ 50%
  - Obs/Exp CpG ratio â‰¥ 0.6
  - Minimum length â‰¥ 200 bp
- Overlaid MM/ML data to compute:
  - % of methylated CpGs per island
  - % of total island bases methylated
- Classified CpG islands as methylated if â‰¥70% CpGs were methylated
- Summary:
  - Total CpG islands: 5,427,765
  - Methylated islands (â‰¥70%): 5,123,226 (94.4%)

### 4. Genome Chunking and Gene Prediction
- Split genome into ~2,800 contigs across 56 batches
- Ran AUGUSTUS via Bash in Colab on each batch using:
  ```
  --species=fly
  --gff3=on
  --UTR=on
  --print_utr=on
  --protein=on
  ```
- Saved GFF outputs in `augustus_output/`
- Parsed and converted all GFF files to BED format

### 5. CpGâ€“Gene Association (Promoter Proximity)
- Converted AUGUSTUS `.gff` to `.bed` format with gene coordinates
- Sorted and merged BED files: `merged_augustus_genes_sorted.bed`
- Extracted strand-aware 1000 bp upstream promoter regions: `gene_promoters.bed`
- Used `bedtools closest` to associate each promoter with its nearest CpG island
- Filtered for CpG islands that:
  - Are within 1000 bp of promoter
  - Have â‰¥2 methylated CpG sites
- Final output: `filtered_promoter_cpg_pairs.csv` (414,640 high-confidence rows)

### 6. Transcriptome-Informed Gene Prediction (Ongoing)
- Processed two *Synalpheus* transcriptomes:
  - *S. brooksi* and *S. elizabethae*
- Aligned transcriptomes to genome using `minimap2`
- Converted alignments to sorted BAM format using `samtools`
- Extracted splice junctions and hints using `regtools` and `bam2hints`
- These hints are being integrated into updated AUGUSTUS runs

##  Research Significance

This study offers one of the first genome-wide methylation analyses in a eusocial marine invertebrate. By integrating long-read methylation data, CpG island annotation, gene prediction, and transcriptome-informed evidence, this project identifies candidate epigenetic regulatory mechanisms underlying eusociality in *Synalpheus*. It broadens the taxonomic scope of epigenetic research beyond insects and provides insight into the evolution of social complexity.
